//execution occurs in three phase
//1 - Global execution --> assign to "this" keyword
//2 - Memory Phase then memory is assigned to values (only memory not value) they are assigned undefined
//and the functions in the program are not assigned undefined thier definition is passed
//3 - execution phase then values are given that are assigned undefined and for the function that are called and 
//all the operations or calculations are done
//execution context of function is deleted after return
//these steps are repeated same  --> new variable enivornment then execution thread => memory phase then execution phase
